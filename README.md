# Islands
A simple minecraft mod that adds a new World Type generating an endless ocean filled with islands.

* For Singleplayer:
    1. When starting a new world open the "More World Options..." menu
    2. Set the World Type to Islands
    3. Create the world

* For Multiplayer:
    1. Open the server.properties file found in the same folder as your server
    2. Add `use-modded-worldtype=islands` at the end of the file
    3. Save it
    4. Make sure the server doesn't already have a world generated, **this only works when first generating the server's world!**

## How to Install
1. Download and install MinecraftForge from their [official website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
	* This Mod is made using 1.14.4 - 28.2.21, so using that version or something higher than it is recommended
2. Download the Mod from either our [official website](https://pixelatedw.xyz/islands/downloads), or the [curse page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/islands)
3. Create a new "mods" folder, if not already present, inside your ".minecraft" folder
    * On Windows the ".minecraft" folder can be found by pressing Windows Key + R and running the %appdata% command
    * On Linux it can be found inside the "~/.minecraft" directory
    * On macOS it can be found inside "~/Library/Application Support/minecraft" directory
4. Move the Mod file (the .jar file) inside this folder
5. Start Minecraft and choose the newly created "forge" profile
6. Enjoy
